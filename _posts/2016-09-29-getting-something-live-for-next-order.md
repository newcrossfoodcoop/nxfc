Foo

**Carlos asks**: _"Can we use the site for the next order?"_  
**Ben replies**: _"Can I answer that at the end of Thursday?"_

It's Thursday now, I'm still not sure, but I think we can, if we provide:

* the basket and the placement of an order (*no payment*)
* the latest products from [Suma](http://www.suma.coop)
* the site on the [www.newcrossfoodcoop.org.uk](http://www.newcrossfoodcoop.org.uk) domain

What will users see?

* they will be able to choose products
* know their order total
* place their order

What will need to be done before people start placing their orders?

* some basic content added to the site so it's not confusing [issue](https://github.com/newcrossfoodcoop/nxfc/issues/54)
* product ingest into the production site [issue](https://github.com/newcrossfoodcoop/nxfc/issues/56)
* completion of the product code migration [issue](https://github.com/newcrossfoodcoop/nxfc/issues/55)

What will need to be done before the order is placed with Suma?

* the report for supplier ordering [issue](https://github.com/newcrossfoodcoop/nxfc/issues/57)

What will need to be done before the collection day?

* the report for splitting the order [issue](https://github.com/newcrossfoodcoop/nxfc/issues/58)
