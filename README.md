[![Dependency Status](https://david-dm.org/newcrossfoodcoop/nxfc.svg)](https://david-dm.org/newcrossfoodcoop/nxfc)

The website is based on: 

* [MEAN.JS 0.4.0](https://github.com/meanjs/mean/tree/0.4.0) a Node.js development framework.

## Getting started
To make getting started as easy as possible we are using: 

* [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) to provide "containers" to run our app and its dependant services in

These allow our application to run happily and consistently on Linux, MacOSX and Windows in only a few commands.

### 1. Install Docker

* Install [Docker](http://www.docker.com/)

### 2. Clone The GitHub Repository
```
$ git clone https://github.com/newcrossfoodcoop/nxfc.git nxfc
```
This will clone the latest version of the repository to a **nxfc** folder.

### 3. Start The App
```
$ docker-compose up
```
Docker will now download a couple of container images, build them and then run them, this could take a few minutes the first time but will be much quicker the next time.

The website should now be running on the 3000 port so in your browser just go to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
                            
That's it! You should now have two containers running one running mongodb and one running the website.

Head to the [wiki](https://github.com/newcrossfoodcoop/nxfc/wiki/Home) to find out how to work with the app.
